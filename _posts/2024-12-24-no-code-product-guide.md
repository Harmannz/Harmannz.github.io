## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Setting Up the Foundation (Estimated time: 4-6 hours)

Begin by creating a new project in Bubble.io and establishing your data structure:

1. Create your database structure in Bubble:
   - Jobs: title, description, company, location, salary, requirements, post date, expiry date, status
   - Companies: name, description, logo, website, contact information
   - Users: email, name, resume, job preferences, application history

2. Design your main pages:
   - Homepage with featured jobs
   - Job listing page with search/filter
   - Individual job posting page
   - Company profile page
   - User dashboard
   - Admin dashboard

### Phase 2: Building Core Functionality (Estimated time: 8-10 hours)

#### Job Posting Workflow

1. Create the job submission form:
   ```
   Workflow in Bubble:
   - Create a new page: "Post a Job"
   - Add input fields for all job details
   - Set up "Submit" button workflow:
     1. Create new "Job" entry
     2. Upload company logo to "Images" storage
     3. Redirect to payment page
   ```

2. Implement search functionality:
   ```
   Search Configuration:
   - Create search input group
   - Set up dynamic filtering:
     - Location (text match)
     - Salary range (number range)
     - Job type (exact match)
     - Keywords (contains)
   ```

### Phase 3: Integration Implementation (Estimated time: 6-8 hours)

#### Payment Processing with Stripe

1. Connect Stripe in Bubble:
   - Install Stripe plugin
   - Configure webhook endpoints
   - Set up product pricing tiers

2. Create payment workflow:
   ```
   Payment Flow:
   1. User submits job posting
   2. Redirect to payment page
   3. Process payment through Stripe
   4. On success: Activate job posting
   5. Send confirmation email
   ```

#### Email Notification System

Set up Mailchimp integration:
```
Email Workflows:
1. New job alert to matching candidates
2. Application received (to employer)
3. Application confirmation (to candidate)
4. Job posting expiration warning
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance with Large Data Sets
